#Instructions
Download and run the MitM file for the basic assignment. We did agree early on that MitM was a bit small given the size of our group, so we elected to add several extra sections including a Packet Sniffer, and a Dictionary Attack for any HTTP packets found carrying hashes in the sniff. The group performed their individual work well, however the complicated case of trying to mass debug the final product, especially all at once introduced some errors into the code and prevented further debugging. That said, once again everyone did well and worked hard, just the final mashup proved to be difficult. We all uploaded our final individual works as proof that we did despite the collective goof individually produce valid products.
